# Supplementary videos

These videos are in support of the Phd Thesis of Jaideep Joshi, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, titled "The spatial and coevolutionary dynamics of cooperation" 

These videos provide schematic snaphots of the simulated systems over ecological timescales.

Video S2.1 - Movement types
==========


Representative videos showing the range of movement types that our model can exhibit, by changing the cohesive tendency of individuals. (Cohesive tendency is Rs in the active case and γ in the passive case; see S1 Appendix). In the passive system case, the background colours show the potential field of the turbulent fluid. For very low cohesive tendencies, individuals remain mostly solitary. For intermediate values of cohesive tendency, we get fission-fusion groups. For large values of cohesive tendency, we get very few large groups. In these simulations, the cohesive tendency of all individuals is identical.

Video S2.2 - Self-sorting
==============
Representative videos showing assortment due to a difference in cohesive tendencies of cooperators and defectors. There is no assortment when the cohesive tendencies (Rs in passive case and γ in active case) of cooperators and defectors are same. In these simulations, we have exaggerated the difference to make the assortment visually apparent.

Video S5.1 - Consumer-resource system
=========

Representative video showing consumers exploiting a renewable resource. Each consumer (red square) exploits resource in its local area and disperses to another location once the local resource drops below a certain threshold (white indicates 100% resource level and black represents zero resource).
